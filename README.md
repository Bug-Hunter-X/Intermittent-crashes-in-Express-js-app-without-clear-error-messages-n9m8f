# Express.js Intermittent Crash Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in an Express.js application where the server crashes intermittently without providing useful error messages. The crash seems to be triggered by a high volume of requests, but the exact cause is hard to pinpoint due to the lack of informative error logs.

## Bug Description

The Express.js application, when under load, may unexpectedly crash without any detailed error messages in the console.  This makes debugging and identifying the root cause very challenging.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send a large number of requests to the server (e.g., using a load testing tool).  The crash is not guaranteed, but should occur with enough load.

## Solution

The solution involves improving error handling within the Express.js application by using more robust error-handling mechanisms. This allows the application to handle exceptions gracefully, logging useful information to help with debugging.
